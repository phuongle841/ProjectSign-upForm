what I learn in this project:
    + index:
        - More div-s mean more complexity, but easier to positioning them.
        - Form: just follow the Assignment link in form basis and form validation.
    - js: confirm matching form
        - Both input and confirm input need event listener
    - css:
        - Width of the container is important and it's not a shame to style them fixed (difference form %)
        - Img back-ground can be add later and sizing by background-size
        - input button have outline, this attribute make border harder to recognize.
        - animation time depend on transition attribute in css.
        - flex: 1 or 2 is very useful (revive flex, later if can)
        - add new font by @font-face
